>  The goal is to transport people in an efficient manner.
Depending on how well you do it, you can progress through the ever more difficult challenges.
Only the very best programs will be able to complete all the challenges.

Like most of these activities, there are two "windows"- one containing your
code (below) and one containing your code *execution* (above). To run the code,
simply press **Apply**. You can also speed up or slow down the program's
execution.

After completing the first two challenges, check out the documentation which is
linked in the activity- you may find there are additional strategies you can
use.
