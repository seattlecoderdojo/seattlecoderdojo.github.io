## Welcome to the Hacker Room!

This web portal exists as a collection of resources for students (and parents)
to find their way through the wonderful world of computer programming. Our goal
is **to give students the resources and help they need in order to work on
projects on their own**.

To achieve this, we've broken up this portal into three categories:
1. **Beginner**: You don't know what you don't know. We will offer clear
   tutorials that teach the basics of computer programming. Although we may
   choose one language, the concepts learned here apply to most, if not all
   languages.
2. **Intermediate**: Now that you know the basics, we've collected a list of
   tutorials and projects that we think will help you grow and explore this
   world.
3. **Expert**: Wow! You're ready to learn the hard stuff, like development
   practices, web frameworks, and data structures.

Additionally, all of our tutorials are *tagged*, giving them topics you can
search for. This makes it easy to find the activities that interest you.

To get started, see a volunteer so we can get you a tracking sheet, then simply
visit any of the links in the top right corner of this page.
